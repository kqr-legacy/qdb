<p>Sad the lives of man and hero,<br />
Sad the homes of ocean-dwellers,<br />
If the sun shines not upon them,<br />
If the moonlight does not cheer them<br />
Is there not some mighty hero,<br />
Was there never born a giant,<br />
That can fell the mighty oak-tree,<br />
That can lop its hundred branches?<br />
Wainamoinen, deeply thinking,<br />
Spake these words soliloquizing:<br />
<strong>404</strong></p>
